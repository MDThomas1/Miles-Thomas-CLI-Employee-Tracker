## Installation
This application is entirely back-end-run and will require downloading of the code to use. Additionally, access to the MYSQL command line extension will be required. A schema.sql file is included for setting up the required database and tables.

## Usage
To begin this application you must go into an integrated terminal and enter node server.js. Once there you'll be taken to an inquirer prompt giving you a list of options of what you can do within the app. Among these are three options for viewing your company data, each of which will provide a list of either your employees, your roles or your databases, along with relevant information. You can also very simply add to each of these by slecting what table you want to add to and following the prompt to add all the necessary information. Employee roles can also be updated through this formula. Finally, once you are done with the data, you can select the prompt option to exit the app.
